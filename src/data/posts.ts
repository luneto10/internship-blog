            "They make the best pastrami bagels I’ve ever had, but the real star is their Croque Madame with fries — crispy, cheesy, and perfect. I always pair it with a creamy latte, and it’s the perfect way to start the day.",
            "I also love the pastries, especially the Tiramisu and the Crème Brûlée. It’s like a warm hug in a pastry.",

            "I also went with my family to the Museu do Ipiranga (Ipiranga Museum), inside Parque da Independência (Independence Park). The building is classic and the galleries tell Brazil’s history in a way that actually keeps you awake.",
            "That big painting in my photos is “Independência ou Morte!” (Independence or Death!) by Pedro Américo. It shows Dom Pedro I proclaiming Brazil’s independence on September 7, 1822, near the Ipiranga stream — dramatic horses, raised swords, the whole epic moment that marks the birth of the nation.",
            "In between museums and murals, I played a lot of basketball — pickup games on neighborhood courts until my legs begged for mercy. Best stress relief in the city.",
            "If you’re in São Paulo, you should visit these spots. Beco do Batman for the vibes, Museu do Ipiranga for the story, and any court for a quick game. Trust me — perfect combo.",

            "Working on the IT FX team at BTG Pactual showed me how big-company software really works. The systems are large, sometimes fast, and audited. It was pressure, but the good kind.",
            "I learned microservices the practical way: services talking over APIs and message queues, and a lot of AWS. I also had to read many repos and understand how they connect, which made me faster at finding the right place to change.",
            "Database work became a daily skill. I used relational and NoSQL (DynamoDB), learned when to pick each one, wrote efficient queries, added indexes, and thought about real-time data needs.",
            "The CI/CD pipeline opened my eyes: automated tests, code quality gates, and safe deployments.",
            "Security was everywhere: authentication, roles and permissions, secret management, and encryption in transit and at rest. I also saw why compliance and audit logs matter in finance.",
            "Performance became a habit. With high-frequency data, every millisecond counts. I profiled hot paths, batched calls, cached what made sense, and used async patterns to keep things smooth.",

            "Teamwork was daily life. Projects crossed teams, so I learned to listen, align expectations, and turn business needs into practical tasks we could deliver.",
            "Time management got sharper. With many parallel tasks, I set priorities by impact and urgency, protected focus time, and gave status early to avoid surprises.",
            "Problem-solving moved beyond code. I learned to find root causes, ask better questions, and fix the real issue.",
            "Adaptability became natural. New tools, new rules, and quick changes are normal in fintech, so I learned fast and kept moving. Our systems are all connected, every we are consuming and producing data from other teams. To understand a simple feature, I had to understand the whole system. Talking in one day with 7 teams to understand the workflow of a currency exchange.",
            "Leadership showed up as ownership (BTG Pactual value). I ran small demos, unblocked teammates, and documented steps so others could repeat wins without me.",
